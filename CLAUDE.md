# Nimbus — Claude Code Context

## Project Overview

Nimbus is a **local-first AI agent framework** — a headless Bun Gateway process that maintains a private SQLite index of the user's data across cloud services (Google Drive, Gmail, Google Photos, OneDrive, Outlook, Microsoft Teams, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Slack, Linear, Jira, Notion, Confluence, Discord opt-in, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, GitLab CI, PagerDuty, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure, GCP, IaC CLIs, Grafana, Sentry, New Relic, Datadog, optional `[[filesystem.roots]]` indexing, and the local filesystem via first-party MCP connectors) and executes multi-step agentic workflows on their behalf. Clients (CLI and Tauri 2.0 desktop app) communicate with the Gateway exclusively over JSON-RPC 2.0 IPC.

**Runtime:** Bun v1.2+ / TypeScript 6.x strict
**Linter:** Biome
**License:** AGPL-3.0 (gateway/cli/mcp-connectors) + MIT (sdk)
**Status:** Phase 3 — Intelligence ✅ complete; **Phase 3.5** is the next roadmap focus

**Gemini CLI:** [`GEMINI.md`](./GEMINI.md) mirrors this file for the same repository — update both when changing commands, roadmap rows, or non-negotiables.

## Non-Negotiables

These constraints are architectural, not preferences. Do not suggest changes that violate them:

| # | Constraint | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Local-first** | Machine is the source of truth; cloud is a connector |
| 2 | **HITL is structural** | Consent gate is in the executor, not the prompt; cannot be bypassed or configured away |
| 3 | **No plaintext credentials** | Vault only (DPAPI/Keychain/libsecret); never in logs/IPC/config |
| 4 | **MCP as connector standard** | Engine never calls cloud APIs directly |
| 5 | **Platform equality** | Windows/macOS/Linux are equally supported; PRs gate on Ubuntu (`pr-quality`); pushes run the full 3-OS matrix |
| 6 | **AGPL-3.0 core / MIT SDK** | Dual license is intentional; do not change license fields |
| 7 | **No `any`** | Use `unknown` for external data; TypeScript strict mode is non-negotiable |

## Package Dependency Rules

```
gateway    ← no imports from cli or ui
cli        ← IPC-only communication with gateway (no source imports)
ui         ← IPC-only communication with gateway (no source imports)
sdk        ← no imports from gateway, cli, or ui
mcp-connectors/*  ← depend on @nimbus-dev/sdk only
```

Circular dependencies are forbidden. The CLI and UI never import Gateway TypeScript.

---

## Testing Philosophy

A system that orchestrates real actions against real data cannot rely on developer confidence. Every behavioral contract is verified by automated tests on all three platforms.

- **HITL tests** prove the gate fires for every action type in the whitelist, before the connector is called
- **Vault tests** prove no secret value is exposed through any interface
- **Integration tests** use real SQLite, real Bun subprocesses, fresh temp dirs per test — no mocks at the DB layer
- **E2E CLI tests** use a real Gateway subprocess + mock MCP servers (wire protocol, no real cloud calls)
- **Coverage gates** are enforced in CI: Engine ≥85%, Vault ≥90%, Embedding ≥80%, plus scheduler, rate limiter, and people thresholds (see `.github/workflows/_test-suite.yml`)

## Roadmap Context

> Full roadmap with acceptance criteria and inter-quarter dependencies: [`docs/roadmap.md`](./docs/roadmap.md)

| Phase | Theme | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Foundation — Gateway, PAL, Vault, filesystem connector, HITL, CLI, CI | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 2 | The Bridge — 15 MCP connectors, unified index, people graph, context ranker, installers | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3 | Intelligence — Semantic layer, extensions, CI/CD + cloud MCPs, workflows, watchers | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 3.5 | Observability — Connector health model, `nimbus query` / `diag` / `doctor` / `db`, config profiles, `@nimbus-dev/client`, telemetry, docs site | 🔵 Current focus |
| Phase 4 | Presence — Tauri UI, VS Code ext, local LLM (Ollama), multi-agent, data portability | Planned |
| Phase 5 | The Extended Surface — browser/reading, IMAP, finance, CRM, HR, design connectors; Marketplace v2 | Planned |
| Phase 6 | Team — federation, Team Vault, shared namespaces, SSO/SCIM, multi-user HITL, org policy | Planned |
| Phase 7 | The Autonomous Agent — standing approvals, scheduled tasks, incident correlation, fine-tuning, SRE loop | Planned |
| Phase 8 | Sovereign Mesh — P2P sync, mobile companion, hardware vault, DIDs, Digital Executor | Planned |
| Phase 9 | Enterprise — Docker/Helm, SIEM, compliance, SCIM, admin console, security audit, SLA | Planned |

When implementing, focus only on the current phase. Do not add Phase N+1 features in Phase N code.

## Subsystems (monorepo)

- `packages/gateway` — Engine, MCP mesh, Vault, local index, IPC
- `packages/cli` — Terminal client
- `packages/ui` — Tauri 2.0 + React (desktop)
- `packages/sdk` — `@nimbus-dev/sdk` for extensions (MIT)
- `packages/mcp-connectors/*` — First-party MCP servers (AGPL)

**PAL:** All OS-specific logic lives under `packages/gateway/src/platform/` and is accessed via `PlatformServices` — never import `win32` / `darwin` / `linux` from business logic.

**Prerequisites:** Bun v1.2+; Rust for building the Tauri UI (`packages/ui/src-tauri`).
