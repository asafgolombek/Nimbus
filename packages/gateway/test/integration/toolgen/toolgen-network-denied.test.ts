/**
 * The load-bearing test of the whole runtime-tool-generation feature: proof that a raw `fetch()`
 * inside a GENERATED tool's confined process genuinely fails to reach the network, on every
 * platform Nimbus ships on. Every other safeguard in the feature — the host allow-list, credential
 * binding, the egress ledger — assumes the generated body has no route out except the gateway
 * broker. If a raw `fetch()` worked, all of that would be theater.
 *
 * Guard shape (Windows helper path override, set before any `createSandboxRunner()` call) is
 * copied deliberately from `exec-sandbox.test.ts` / `sandbox-wrapper-spawn.test.ts`: under `bun
 * test`, `process.execPath` resolves to the installed `~/.bun/bin/bun.exe`, not this repo's
 * `src-native` build output, and the runner captures the probe result at construction.
